# ?? Useful Gnomes – A R.E.P.O. Mod

**Useful Gnomes** is a mod for the game [R.E.P.O.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2532120/REPO/) that reworks gnome enemy behavior into something... well, a little more helpful.

## ?? What It Does

In **v1**, gnomes will still spawn and wander around — but they no longer engage in combat. Think of them as *ambient chaos with no bite*. This is a foundation mod for bigger behavior shifts coming soon.

## ?? Features

- Prevents gnome AI from entering aggressive or attack states
- Keeps pathing and roaming intact
- Logs spawn positions for debugging (or gnome-tracking purposes)
- Lightweight, patch-only implementation (no asset changes... yet)

## ?? Roadmap

| Version | Feature |
|---------|---------|
| **v1** | All gnomes are passive and cannot attack |
| **v2** | Hostile gnomes are reintroduced with color differences (friendly vs. enemy) |
| **v3** | Friendly gnomes guide you toward nearby loot |
