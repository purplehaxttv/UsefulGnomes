# 🧙‍♂️ Useful Gnomes

This mod turns those pesky gnomes in **R.E.P.O.** into something a little more... chill.

Instead of charging at you with rage and questionable life goals, they now just... vibe. They still roam, they still move — but they won't attack. They're basically just little guys on a journey. Aren't we all?

## ❓ What It Does

- Disables gnome combat states — no more gnome aggro!
- Gnomes still wander around like normal, just without the murder.
- Logs when each gnome spawns, so you can track your tiny new friends.
- No visual changes yet... but maybe they’ll get a makeover soon. ;)

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Use [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/thunderstore-thunderstore-mod-manager)  
   – or –
2. Manually drop the `.dll` into your BepInEx `plugins/` folder.

## 🔮 Future Plans

- **v2**: Reintroduce hostile gnomes alongside friendly ones (with color-coded models).
- **v3**: Friendly gnomes will lead you to nearby loot. Yes, seriously.

Keep your gnomes useful, not hostile.
